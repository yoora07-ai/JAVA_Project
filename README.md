# BLParser

## Overview
BLParser is a recursive-descent parser for the BL (Bugs Language) programming language, developed at The Ohio State University.

This project focuses on compiler front-end design, formal grammar parsing, and strict adherence to component-based software engineering principles using the OSU Components Library.

## Key Concepts
- Recursive-descent parsing
- Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
- Token stream processing
- Compiler front-end architecture
- Design by Contract

# ListWithRetreat

## Overview
ListWithRetreat is a custom list component that extends standard list behavior by supporting backward cursor movement during iteration.

The project emphasizes abstract data types (ADT), representation invariants, and kernel vs. secondary method design.

## Key Concepts
- Cursor-based list traversal
- Abstract data types
- Representation invariants
- Component layering

# ProgramAndStatement

## Overview
ProgramAndStatement implements core abstractions for representing, manipulating, and generating code from BL programs and statements.

This project explores abstract syntax trees (ASTs), program transformation, and compiler back-end concepts.

## Key Concepts
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Program representation
- Code generation
- Recursive traversal

# SortingMachineWithHeapSort

## Overview
SortingMachineWithHeapSort implements a SortingMachine component backed by the Heap Sort algorithm.

This project focuses on algorithm efficiency, comparator-based ordering, and strict compliance with component contracts.

## Key Concepts
- Heap Sort
- Priority queues
- Comparator-based ordering
- Algorithmic complexity

# TagCloudGenerator

## Overview
TagCloudGenerator generates an HTML tag cloud from an input text file, visually representing word frequencies using scalable font sizes.

The project combines text processing, sorting, and presentation logic.

## Key Concepts
- Text parsing and normalization
- Frequency analysis
- Sorting with custom comparators
- Data visualization logic

---

# WordCounter

## Overview
WordCounter is a text analysis program that reads input files and reports word frequency statistics.

This project emphasizes correctness, clean data processing, and component-based iteration.

## Key Concepts
- Tokenization
- Frequency counting
- Map-based aggregation
- File input and output
